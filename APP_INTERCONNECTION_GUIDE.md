## 🎯 Best Practices for Maintaining Interconnections

1. **Always Pass Context IDs**
   - Use URL parameters (jobId, clientId, etc.)
   - Maintain consistent parameter naming
   - Validate IDs before processing

2. **Implement Breadcrumbs**
   - Show user's location in workflow
   - Provide back navigation
   - Display workflow progress

3. **Status-Based Navigation**
   - Show relevant actions based on current state
   - Hide/disable inappropriate actions
   - Guide users through workflow steps

4. **Error Handling**
   - Validate data before transitions
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Suggest corrective actions

5. **Real-Time Updates**
   - Sync data across modules
   - Use WebSocket for live updates
   - Show last updated timestamps

## 📝 Notes

- All interconnections use React's `Link` component for client-side routing
- URL parameters are preserved across navigation
- Suspense boundaries prevent hydration mismatches
- Modal states are maintained during navigation
- Data refresh on page mount ensures consistency
